title: "Rustlings: An awesome start to Rust"
---
I recently completed [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), and I have to say that it is a great start for learning Rust. It's a small hands-on learning course based on small exercises with hints if you are stuck and a README in each group of exercises with helpful resources and explainations.

It goes through many core parts of Rust, from functions and generics to move semantics and parallelization, and makes sure that you know the fundamentals. Even though it covers a lot, it isn't overly long and is an awesome resource that I would recommend for anyone who is interesting in learning.

To start, install Rust if you don't have it (personally, I used [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), but there are plenty of ways to install). Then, you can run a simple setup command provided at the [github repo of rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and afterwards follow the instructions provided. Once you start, you can edit the files and whenever you save your script will automatically run again in the console. You can then edit the files with your editor of choice.
