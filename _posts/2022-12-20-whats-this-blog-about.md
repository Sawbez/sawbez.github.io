title: "What's this blog about?"
---

Well, I've finally come up with a conclusion to this. This blog
will be about a couple things:
- Tracking my progress
- Cool stuff I found
- Concepts I find interesting
- Probably more.
These posts will probably be moved to a custom blog, but this will do for now.

## Plans:
- Sooooo much cool stuff on github. The list is endless.
- Some coding stuff
- Math stuff I'm working on
- Other generally nerdy stuff
