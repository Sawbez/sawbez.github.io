I wanted to wrap some sort of API in a TUI, and I heard about this cool Go package called [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
I haven't had much experience with Go, but wanted to try it so I tried it out and made [vivid](https://github.com/Sawbez/vivid). It allows you to find a cool color scheme and can be
based for a certain style if you want. It was pretty fun to make and I'm glad I tried out Go and bubbletea.
