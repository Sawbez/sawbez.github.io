title: "The 52 Project Challenge"
---

I recently had a thought slightly after New Year's:

*There are fifty-two weeks in a year, and fifty-two projects
sounds really impressive. So, if I do a project a week, I
will have a massiev portfolio!*

So, I propose a challenge. Create one project a week, no matter
how small or big, and see what you can accomplish!
