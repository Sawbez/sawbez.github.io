I made this blog because I want to write about some of the cool things I find out on the internet. This post is mainly a test but soon I will make more posts that are more technical.

This blog is mainly about a couple things:

- Programming 10111010010011
- Math $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
- Science C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
- The internet üåê

Of course I'll occasionally talk about other things too, but those are the main things I want to cover.
